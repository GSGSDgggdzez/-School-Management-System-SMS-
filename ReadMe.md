## Project: School Management System (SMS)

Welcome to the fun zone of the **School Management System (SMS)**! 🎉 As your group leader, I'm here to make this project simple, clear, and fun so we can all thrive together. Here’s your handy dandy guide to what’s coming up, based on our Agile journey! 🚀

---

### 🌟 Project Overview 🌟
The **School Management System (SMS)** is an awesome, web-based platform built to make school life smoother. It handles everything from school registration to class management, attendance tracking, and fee management (yes, fees too). It even generates report cards! 📚✨

We’re using the **Agile Development Model** to make sure we deliver a high-quality system in sprints, with constant feedback and collaboration from everyone involved.

### 🚀 Key Features 🚀

#### 1. **Role-Based Access**
Each person has a special role:

- **School Owner:** The Big Boss! 👑 Registers the school, sets policies, and manages everyone.
- **Admin:** The Right Hand 🖐️. Manages records, tracks attendance, and creates reports.
- **Teacher:** The Class Hero 📖. Manages their classes, takes attendance, and enters grades.
- **Student:** The Superstar 🌟. Checks their grades, attendance, and sends review requests.
- **Parent (Optional):** The Guardian 🛡️. Tracks their child’s progress.

#### 2. **Core Features**
- **School & User Management:** School owners and admins create and manage everything.
- **Attendance Management:** Teachers and admins keep track of who's present.
- **Fee Management (Optional):** Track student payments, fees, and reminders.
- **Report Cards & Academic Tracking:** Teachers input grades; admins review and generate reports.
- **Messaging & Notifications:** All users can communicate and stay updated! 📲

---

### 💻 Tech Stack 💻
We’re using some cool tools to bring this system to life!

- **Frontend:** React.js / Vue.js (for snazzy, dynamic interfaces)
- **Backend:** PHP (because it's reliable and awesome)
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL (so we can store all the school data)
- **Hosting:** AWS or Azure (we’ll keep things scalable!)

---

### 📦 How It Works
Since we’re following the **Agile** model, we will be delivering features in small, manageable chunks (called **sprints**) that will help us build the system step by step:

1. **Sprint 1 - School Registration & User Management:** School owner registers the school and assigns roles to users. 🎓
2. **Sprint 2 - Attendance Management:** Teachers take attendance, and admins can review.
3. **Sprint 3 - Fee Management (Optional):** Admins can track fees and send reminders. 💰
4. **Sprint 4 - Performance Tracking & Report Cards:** Teachers input grades, and admins generate reports for students.
5. **Sprint 5 - Messaging & Notifications:** All users can communicate, stay updated, and get notifications. 📲

Each sprint will be followed by feedback and testing to ensure that the features are meeting the needs of the users.

### 🔧 Database Design (aka the “Behind the Scenes”)
The database is the brain that powers our SMS. Here's what we've got:

- **sms_schools:** Stores all school details like name, logo, and policies.
- **sms_users:** Manages all user accounts, roles, and their info.
- **sms_classes:** Keeps track of classes, teachers, and students.
- **sms_terms:** Manages the school terms and academic cycles.
- **sms_grades:** Records all student grades by subject and term.
- **sms_fees (Optional):** If enabled, stores fee info and payments.

---

### 🎯 Business Logic (How it All Runs Smoothly)
- **Role Management:** Everyone gets only the access they need!
- **Attendance Tracking:** Admins and teachers ensure attendance is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Fee Tracking:** Parents/students get timely reminders for fee payments.
- **Performance Review:** Teachers input grades, and admins review the data.

---

### 💡 Scalability & Performance
As our project grows, we’ve planned to:

- **Database Sharding:** Split the data across servers so it never slows down.
- **Indexing & Caching:** Speed up searches and data access.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more servers as more schools join in!
